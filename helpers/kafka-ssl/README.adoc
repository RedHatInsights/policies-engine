This folder contains files to help test the connection from `policies-engine` to a Kafka instance with SSL.

## Usage

.Generate a jsk keystore for kafka signed by a CA (it can be a self signed CA). You can use the script `create-certs.sh` to generate them locally.

.The server keystore needs to be placed on `certs/server/server-keystore.jks` with password `supersecure` and the ca on
`./certs/ca/cacert.pem` (above script takes care of it).
You can use other paths/password, but you would need to update the `docker-compose.yml` file to use the new params.

```bash
./create-certs.sh
```

. Start the docker-compose instance

```bash
docker-compose up
```

.Start `policies-engine` passing the following environment variables:

```bash
KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS="localhost:29092" \
KAFKA_SECURITY_PROTOCOL="SSL" \
KAFKA_SSL_TRUSTSTORE_LOCATION="`pwd`/../helpers/kafka-ssl/certs/ca/cacert.pem" \
KAFKA_SSL_TRUSTSTORE_TYPE="PEM" \
KAFKA_SSL_ENDPOINT_IDENTIFICATION_ALGORITHM="" \
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```
