= Policies Engine
:source-language: java

[.lead]
This project contains the execution engine for policies service. For the user-facing UI-backend see https://github.com/RedHatInsights/policies-ui-backend

This repository contains parts of the Hawkular-Alerts core. It is not interchangeable with the previous maven modules as stuff has been moved around, removed and modified. For the old documentation (not necessarily relevant in all parts), see:
